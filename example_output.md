### 🌍 Exploring Culture – Advanced English (C2)

---

**Warm-up**  
- What defines a person’s culture?  
- Is culture something we choose or inherit?

---

**Vocabulary**  
assimilation, heritage, identity, multiculturalism, norms, stereotype, tradition, perception, diversity, transmission

---

**Reading**  
Culture is the invisible fabric that connects individuals to communities, shaping behaviors, values, and expectations. It is not inherited genetically but transmitted through language, rituals, and social practices. While some aspects of culture are celebrated—like food or festivals—others are internalized subtly, such as attitudes toward time, authority, or gender.

In multicultural societies, individuals often navigate multiple cultural layers. The tension between preserving traditions and adapting to modern norms is ongoing. Cultural identity is often shaped not only by what one learns but by how others perceive and respond to those expressions.

In a globalized world, culture is constantly reshaped, challenged, and reinvented—sometimes celebrated, sometimes stereotyped. Understanding culture involves recognizing not only diversity, but the forces that are exerted on individuals to conform or resist.
